A simple [Citymapper's API](https://citymapper.com/api) wrapper written in R

## Installation

You can install the package running the following command:
```r
remotes::install_github("andodet/citymappR")

# Or using devtools
devtools::install_github("andodet/citymappR")
```

## Usage

The package provides access to Citymapper's API endpoints:

- `citymapper_setup`: initialise Citymapper's api token. Check `?citymapper_setup` for different ways of passing the api token.
- `check_coverage`: check if a geographical point falls within Citymapper's covered area.
- `check_coverage_multi`: same as above, supports multiple inputs by feeding it a dataframe with `id` (optional) and `coord` columns.
- `get_travel_time`: comptues travel time between two points using public transport.

Below you can find a minimal example of how both functions can be used.

```r
library(citymappR)

# Set Citymapper's api key
citymappr_setup()

start_point <- "41.889083,12.470514"
end_point <- "41.899009,12.477243"

# Check coverage for single points
check_coverage(start_point)  # [1] TRUE
check_coverage(end_point)  # [1] TRUE
```

```r
points_df <- data.frame(id = c(123, 456),
                        coord = c("41.889083,12.470514",
                                  "41.899009,12.477243"))

# Check coverage for multiple points
check_coverage_multi(points_df)

#   covered  id            coord
# 1    TRUE 123 41.8891, 12.4705
# 2    TRUE 456 41.8990, 12.4772
```

```r
# Get travel time between two points (minutes)
travel_time <- get_travel_time(start_coord = start_point,
                               end_coord = end_point)

travel_time  # [1] 21
```

## Quotas

Citymapper's quotas and usage limits apply to `citymappeR`. At the time of writing, they go as the following for a standard account:

* `check_coverage`: 10 hit/minute or 1000 hit/day.
* `check_coverage_multi`: 100 hit/minute or 10000 hit/day

## Disclaimer

This package has been developed to familiarise with `httr` package, `jsonlite` and unit testing, PRs or issues are more than appreciated.
